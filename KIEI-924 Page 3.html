          <h2>Tech In Asia</h2>
          <p>
            If you live in south Delhi, chances are you think of a car as your own little palace-on-wheels (worth living and dying for), and it really hurts when this comfort is taken away, even for a day (a flat tyre or the odd-even rule, you never know).
            For spoilt brats like you, I have a suggestion: look into your phone, try the app I am going to tell you about, and give the multiple modes of transport out there a chance.
            From on-demand cabs and radio taxis to three-wheelers, the metro, and public buses, you will find a wide range of options at your disposal (for a car-lover like you, I’m blanking out walking and cycling info – though there’s that too).
            It’s called Instago. You could call it a homegrown version of Google Maps and Moovit, only it is way more
            localized and detailed.

          <p>Intra-city travel application Instago that helps users compare prices and book the cheapest mode of transport across
            different categories including on-demand taxis, autos, public transport and self-drive options is raising $500,000 from multiple investors including angel investor Ramit Sethi of Strongbox Ventures.
            Instago collates information from multiple transport agencies and commuter generated content for
            real-time information on different modes of transport.
            The portal also compiles data through API integration with on-demand transport service
             providers to provide expected time of arrival and other information to the commuters.
