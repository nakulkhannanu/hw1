          <h2>Fortune 500 Experience</h2>
          <p>
            Having previously worked at Google, I have the understanding of the workings of a large technology
            company firsthand. I have worked at various roles and in diverse teams ranging from SMB's to Large Customers.
            I also did a rotation with the People Operations team to better understand how Google hires.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have also worked at Uber for a brief time prior to Kellogg. I worked in the Trust & Safety team.
            I co-developed a national program and worked with cross-functional and city leads to launch the same.
            This experience allowed me to understand how a tap on a mobile phone needs to translate to physical vehicles
            that need to move around a city to reach customers.
          </p>

        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <h2>Entrepreneurial Experience</h2>
          <p>I am certainly an accidental entrepreneur. It all started at the age of 17 when I filed
          a patent for my invention of a massaging shoe. My next venture was in the apparel space as I
         bootstraped $50 and converted into six figure revenues over six years organically.</p>
          <p>
            My latest venture is a meta aggregator for taxis and public transportation. I co-founded
            and led the development of the app and did so in a lean manner. We grew the app to one of <thead>
              top 40 transport apps in India for both Android & iOS.
            </thead>

        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>I am pursuing the one year MBA at Kellogg and have chosen Marketing and Operations as my major.
          To develop my technical skills, I am also taking courses such as Intro to Software Development and will
        follow it up with KIEI 925 in the spring.</p>
          <p>
          I pursued my undergraduate degree in finance at the University of Delhi. I graduated amongst the top 5% of the batch
          and was placed 2nd in the entrance test in the entire country amongst 20,000 aspirants.
